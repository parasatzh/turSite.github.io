<div class="siteblock"><h2 class="sitename" id="SITECODE"> 1. Statue of Liberty </h2>

<img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/22/195522-050-6C15247F/Statue-of-Liberty-Upper-New-York-Bay.jpg" alt="Statue of Liberty" width="730" height="487"><figcaption>Statue of Liberty</figcaption> <p>America's most iconic sight, the Statue of Liberty is at the top of every first-time visitor's list of things to do in New York. It was France's gift to America. Built in 1886, it remains a world symbol of freedom and is one of the top attractions in America. </p>

<p>Canals are as important a part of Amsterdam's cityscape as they are to the city of Venice, and some of the most enduring memories for any visitor are the time spent exploring the city's wonderful waterways. </p>

<p>Tickets to go inside the statue sell out. Pre-purchasing tickets is a must during the high season and a good idea at any time of year. The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island Tour takes you to both the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. This tour allows reserved access to board the ferry, and includes access to the Museum at Ellis Island.</p>

In winter, you can even lace up your skates and glide across Wollman Rink. This huge park in the city center, a half-mile wide and 2.5 miles long, is one of the things that makes New York such a beautiful and livable city.</p>

<p>Besides being a great place to experience a little nature, Central Park has many attractions within its borders, and most of them are free, making it one of the few cheap things to do in NYC. Some of the most popular places to visit include the Belvedere Castle, Strawberry Fields, the Central Park Zoo, and the Lake. If you are exploring the park on your own, start by picking up a map at one of the visitor centers and plot your route.</p>

  
  </div><div class="siteblock"><h2 class="sitename" id="SITECODE">3. Times Square</h2>

<img src="https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2017/04/times-square-new-york-redesign-pedestrian-area-snohetta-midtown-manhattan-opening_dezeen_hero.jpg" alt="Times Square" width="730" height="526"><figcaption>Times Square</figcaption><p>Lined with huge, brilliantly lit billboards and screens, Times Square is the place to go in New York in the evening, but still exciting at any time of day. This is the location of New York's New Year's Eve Celebrations and the famous "ball drop" at midnight, when the square and surrounding streets are filled with people. </p>

<p>Times Square is busy and perpetually crowded but has its own unique appeal. Bleachers set up at one end are a great place to take a break and appreciate the scene. Formerly Longacre Square, Times Square was named in 1904 after the New York Times tower. The newspaper first posted current headlines along its moving sign, the first of its kind in the world, in 1928.</p>

<p>If you've had your fill of sitting on the bleachers and are looking for something fun to do either as a group or a couple, stroll over to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum. The eerily life-like wax figurines feature NYC icons like Jimmy Fallon and the set of The Tonight Show, Broadway cast members, and shows where you actually get to dress up and participate. The building's glass dome protrudes over Times Square for awesome views.</p>

</div><div class="siteblock"><h2 class="sitename" id="SITECODE">4.  Brooklyn Bridge</h2>

<img src="https://www.nycgo.com/images/venues/158/brooklyn-bridge-photo-julienne-schaer-nyc-and-company-003-2__large.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Bridge" width="730" height="487"><figcaption>Brooklyn Bridge </figcaption><p>The Brooklyn Bridge, with its Gothic-shaped arches and suspension cables, is one of the city's most recognizable landmarks and has inspired generations of poets, songwriters, and painters. This historic bridge, spanning the East River from Manhattan to Brooklyn, was completed in 1883 and was the world's first steel suspension bridge.</p>

<p>You can see it from many of the ferries, or the east side of Manhattan, but the best way to experience this icon is to take an hour and walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. A wood plank walkway, only open to pedestrians and cyclists, runs above the lanes of traffic. If you are not up for walking the whole distance, at least go as far as the first pillar, where there is a viewing platform, and you can see one of the granite towers up close.</p>

<p>From the bridge are beautiful views over Manhattan, the East River, and beyond to the Statue of Liberty. Biking over the bridge is another option, but pedestrian traffic is often very heavy, and cycling can be slow and challenging on busy days. Be aware that the access to the bridge begins well back from the water's edge.</p>
  
  </div><div class="siteblock"><h2 class="sitename" id="SITECODE">5.  Metropolitan Museum of Art</h2>

<img src="https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/55d362f337284fb1079ccc4b/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/metropolitan-museum-of-art-new-york-city.jpg" alt="Norwegian Folk Museum (Norsk Folkemuseum) in the Bygdoy Peninsula" width="730" height="489"><figcaption>Metropolitan Museum of Art</figcaption><p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art, or the Met, as it is commonly known, was founded in 1870, and is one of the most famous museums in the United States. The permanent collection of The Met contains more than two million works of art, spanning a period of 5,000 years. </p>

<p>Although the museum has three sites, the centerpiece is The Met Fifth Avenue. Highlights of this collection include American decorative arts, arms and armor, costumes, Egyptian art, musical instruments, photographs, and much more.</p>

<p>The Met Cloisters, located in Fort Tryon Park in northern Manhattan, is another extremely popular New York museum. This branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, housed in an outstanding structure, built around medieval cloisters, chapels, and halls, focuses on the medieval art and architecture of Europe.</p>
